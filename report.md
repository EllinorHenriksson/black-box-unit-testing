## MathFunctions.sum
- What do you think the actual bug or bugs are?   
I think the actual bug is that b is subtracted from a, not added.

- How many test cases do you think are needed? Why?   
I think you would only need one test case to find the bug, and that is to test two positive integers. However, it is good to cover more of the input domain. To test the "extremes", you would also need one test case to test one or two zero integers, and one to test negative integers.

- Did you find any unexpected behaviors?   
Yes, the function subtracted b from a instead of adding it to a.

## MathFunctions.sumNumbers

## Name class
- What do you think the actual bug or bugs are?
- How many test cases do you think are needed? Why?
- Did you find any unexpected behaviors?

## StringFunctions.printHelloWorld
- Describe specifically how the mocking was done

## Menu class
- Describe specifically how the mocking was done
- Describe specifically how you tested that the menu was reprinted - after invalid input
- What are your reccomendations to the developers of `test_lib` specifically focusing on facilitating testing and making less fragile unit tests.
